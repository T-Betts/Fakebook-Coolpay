# Coolpay API Tech Test
## Scenario

Coolpay is a new company that allows to easily send money to friends through their API.

You work for Fakebook, a successful social network. Youâ€™ve been tasked to integrate Coolpay inside Fakebook. A/B tests show that users prefer to receive money than pokes!

You can find Coolpay documentation here: http://docs.coolpayapi.apiary.io/

You will write a small app that uses Coolplay API in Ruby. The app should be able do the following:

- Authenticate to Coolpay API
- Add recipients
- Send them money
- Check whether a payment was successful
